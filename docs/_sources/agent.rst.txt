Agents

Agents come in two forms:

Physical Agents act using a 5 step algorithm established in SPmodelling's agents. Each stage is broken down below. The Agent recieves
an already filtered perception from the node which is fed into step 1.

Social Agents act using a 5 step algorithm as well, see below.

---------------------------------
Patients Physical Agent Algorithm
---------------------------------

1. Perception
    + Remove Edges where Agent.Energy < Edge.End_Node.Energy
2. Choose
    + Remove Edges where Edge.Mood > Agent.Mood
    + Select from remaining edges using a weighted sampling, we generate the weights as follows:
        +  For each edge we get the agent.inclination values corresponding to the edge.type
        +  We take the list of agent.inclination values and normalize them to give the sample weights
3. Payment
    + If Agent.Energy > Edge.Energy + Edge.End_node.Energy:
        + Deduct Edge.Energy from Agent.Energy
    + Else:
        + Search for carers
        + If a carer has sufficient energy take it
        + Else fail to move
    + Add Edge.Mobility_Modifier to Agent.Mobility
        + Update Agent.Wellbeing
            + If Agent.Mobility <= 0: Agent.Wellbeing = "Fallen"
            + Else If Agent.Mobility > 1: Agent.Wellbeing = "Healthy"
            + Else If Agent.Wellbeing == "Healthy": Agent.Wellbeing = "At Risk"
    + Add Edge.Mood_Modifier to Agent.Mood
4. Move
    + Delete Agents existing location edge
    + Create new edge from agent to Edge.End_Node for the selected Edge

5. Learning
    + Deduct Edge.End_Node.Energy from Agent.Energy
    + Add Edge.End_Node.Mobility_Modifier to Agent.Mobility
        + Update Agent.Wellbeing
            + If Agent.Mobility <= 0: Agent.Wellbeing = "Fallen"
            + Else If Agent.Mobility > 1: Agent.Wellbeing = "Healthy"
            + Else If Agent.Wellbeing == "Healthy": Agent.Wellbeing = "At Risk"
    + Add Edge.End_Node.Mood to Agent.Mood
    + Add Edge.End_Node.Energy to Agent.Energy
    + If new Agent.Energy > Agent.Energy before move:
        Increment Agent.Inclination.Edge.type
    + Else if new Agent.Energy < Agent.Energy before move:
        Decrement Agent.Inclination.Edge.type
    + If Agent.Energy > 0.8:
        Increment Agent.Inclination.social
    + Else if Agent.Energy < 0.2:
        Increment Agent.Inclination.inactivity
    + If Agent.Mood > 0.8:
        Increment Agent.Inclination.social
        Decrement Agent.Inclination.inactivity
    + Else if Agent.Mood < 0.2:
        Decrement Agent.Inclination.social
        Increment Agent.Inclination.inactivity
    + If Agent.Mobility < 0.4:
        Increment Agent.Inclination.medical
        Increment Agent.Inclination.inactivity
    + Else if Agent.Mobility > 0.8:
        Decrement Agent.Inclination.inactivity
    + If Edge.End_Node is Care node:
        Log Agent entering Care
    + If Edge.End_Node has a capacity:
        Add 1 to Edge.End_Node.Load
    + If Agent has left Hospital:
        Log Agent being Discharged

6. Prediction*
    + If Edge.End_Node has Queue:
        Run Agent prediction at new node

Patient Social Agent Algorithm
------------------------------

1. Look
    + Agent checks its local physical environment for co-located agents
2. Update
    + Compares co-located agents and social contacts and updates last usage value for co-located contacts
3. Talk
    + Randomly check to see if a new social contact is forms with a co-located agent based on uniform random number being lower than the following equation based on m the length of the shortest undirected path between :math:`Agent_a` and :math:`Agent_b`
            + where :math:`m <= 6`: :math:`(Agent_a.social + Agent_b.social - 4)/24 + 1/(2m-2)`
            + where :math:`m > 6`: :math:`(Agent_a.social + Agent_b.social -4)/24`
4. Listen
    + If they have a new social contact who has a contact to a carer there is a .5 chance that :math:`Agent_a` also forms a contact with that carer
5. React
    + Checks is agent has too many bonds, if it does:
        + If the length of :math:`Agent_a`'s list of carer contacts is greater than :math:`Agent_a.social`:
            + Drop all social contact with other agents
            + Drop most recently met carers until length is equal to :math:`Agent_a.social`
        + If the length of :math:`Agent_a`'s list of carer contact is equal to :math:`Agent_a.social`
            + Drop all social contact with other agents
        + Else
            + Drop social contacts with other agents created in the last 5 timesteps, starting with the most recent
            + Drop social contacts with the oldest last usage
